Greetings, everyone. My name is Priyanka.

And today, I would like to begin with what the Bhagavad Gita presents as a foundational principle: “Uddhared atmanātmānam” — the self must be lifted by the self.
And I would like to add to that Swami Vivekananda’s call to charge: “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”

Together, they offer a blueprint for leadership. First, the deliberate construction of the self. Then, the application of that self in service to a higher cause.
I believe this is what Coach Donato described as the Championship Standard: service to Mother India.

My life's architecture and purpose follows this exact blueprint.

My short-term phase is inward. I consider it a rigorous project of self-creation. Inspired by my Mother's wisdom: "Swa Karya Ve Swami Karya". To help oneself is to help the world. 
I aim to sharpen my mind through the discipline of data and systems thinking, and to strengthen my body and character with the clarity that comes only through consistent effort.
Reshaping systems requires clarity. It requires strength. And above all, it requires inner stability. That’s the foundation — and it must come first. I see this as sharpening the tool before the sculpting begins.

My long-term phase moves outward. My vision for India emerges as a mode of perception — one that engages with complexity through design, data, and disciplined inquiry.
It is less a fixed endpoint and more an evolving method for structural intervention.
This method resonates with my own lived experiences.

For instance, the recent partial loss of my vision that I have had has taught me how perception evolves when traditional channels narrow.
I’ve come to rely more deeply on pattern recognition than surface level signals.

When I turned to public systems for support, I encountered a deeper challenge: structural blindness.
These experiences served as data points — each one illuminating hidden flaws within our institutional design.

This, therefore, is and shall be the focus of my life’s work: to diagnose these systemic fractures.
To master tools of many shapes, forms, and kinds — whether in science or arts or systems theory — and to use them to make the invisible architecture of our society visible, and more importantly, repairable.

So, dear DexSchool,
I do not come here just for answers. I come seeking sharper tools to ask better questions.
I bring with me a mission forged in lived reality. I now seek the intellectual fire to temper it into lasting service.
Together, we can build an India that is healthier, more educated, and more empowered than ever before.

I am ready to arise, awake, and remain prepared to stop not till the goal is reached — the goal to build, together, an India, I reiterate, an India, that is healthier, more educated, and more empowered than ever before.

For ourselves, for our communities, and for Mother India.

Thank you. Jai Hind.
